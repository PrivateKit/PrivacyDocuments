#### Adding Location Context to Apple/Google Exposure Notification Bluetooth API: MIT SafePaths Encryption Proposals for GPS + Bluetooth [LINK](https://github.com/PrivateKit/PrivacyDocuments/blob/master/LocationContext.pdf)
 - Contact tracing requires a strong understanding of location and context of the infection encounters. Although Bluetooth technology does not provide location or context of the encounters, we present key privacy preserving ideas to capture this context that can be used in or alongside the forthcoming Google/Apple Bluetooth Exposure Notification API (GAEN).

#### Privacy Guidelines for Contact Tracing Applications [LINK](https://github.com/PrivateKit/PrivacyDocuments/blob/master/PrivacyGuideline.pdf)
 - Contact tracing is a very powerful method to implement and enforce social distancing to avoid spreadingof infectious diseases. The traditional approach of contact tracing is time consuming, manpower intensive, dangerousand prone to error due to fatigue or lack of skill. In this work we discuss the various scenarios which a contact tracing application should be able to handle. Wehighlight the privacy handling of some of the prominent contact tracing applications. Additionally, we describe thevarious threat actors who can disrupt its working, or misuse end user’s data, or hamper its mass adoption. Finally,we present privacy guidelines for contact tracing applications from different stakeholder’s perspective.

#### Bluetooth based Proximity, Multi-hop Analysis and Bi-directional Trust: Epidemics and More [LINK](https://github.com/PrivateKit/PrivacyDocuments/blob/master/ContactTracingBeyondBluetooth.pdf)
 - In this paper, we propose a trust layer on top of Bluetooth and similar wireless communication
technologies that can form mesh networks. This layer as a protocol enables computing trust scores based
on proximity and bi-directional transfer of messages in multiple hops across a network of mobile devices.
We describe factors and an approach for determining these trust scores and highlight its applications
during epidemics such as COVID-19 through improved contact-tracing, better privacy and verification
for sensitive data sharing in the numerous Bluetooth and GPS based mobile applications that are being
developed to track the spread.

#### Contact Tracing: Holistic Solution beyond Bluetooth [LINK](https://github.com/PrivateKit/PrivacyDocuments/blob/master/ContactTracingBeyondBluetooth.pdf)
 - Contact tracing is a critical part of reopening society. While manual contact tracing by medical professionals is
essential, there’s growing acknowledgement that supplementing this with digital approaches might make a
significant difference in the speed with which we can reopen. In this paper, we’ll compare some of the existing technologies that can be used to aid contact tracing and
exposure notification efforts, and make the case for using a holistic, multi-modal approach rather than relying
exclusively on a single technology.

#### TRANSPARENCY AND CONSENT - BY DEFAULT [LINK](https://github.com/PrivateKit/PrivacyDocuments/blob/master/TransparencyConsent.pdf)
 - Difficult times lead to clear perspectives. The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has stopped “life as normal” across
much of the world. As governments and healthcare systems put into place strict measures around movement to
slow the rate of infection and minimise the death toll, we are coming into a period of significant citizen
uncertainty. Managing the outbreak of COVID-19 and flattening the curve is now a global challenge. We read about contact tracing a patient in Korea, Patient 31, a woman who went to the hospital after a car
accident, went to a hotel buffet, attended a church, came back to the hospital, and in turn ended up impacting
more than a thousand people. The health authorities and contact tracers had to painstakingly interview more than
a thousand people to back-trace and see who could be at risk to avoid further spread.

#### Private GPS Intersection [LINK](https://github.com/PrivateKit/PrivacyDocuments/blob/master/GpsEncryption.pdf)
 - Exposure notification in GPS based contact tracing platform requires performing intersection of at least two GPS trails, however, these GPS trails are sensitive information about a user and hence requires performing intersection in a private manner. Low entropy in the GPS trails makes this problem even more challenging as brute force becomes feasible. In this paper, we propose methods and system design for performing private GPS trail intersection using secure cryptographic methods. We also highlight potential attacks which can be performed on the proposed techniques.
